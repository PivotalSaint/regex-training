# Regex Training Gist Template

Regex is an interesting way for replacing/modifying documents in coding by locating characters/numbers in markdown to help replace with own coding.

## Summary 

Regular expression consists of multiple inferences including: ^, \w, \d, [a-z], [A-Z], and so on. These are locators to identify: strings, text, functions, and other data sets in coding. By utilizing these tools, coders can find and replace, altering data for better use.  My regex that I chose was Matching a URL â€“ /^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$/
