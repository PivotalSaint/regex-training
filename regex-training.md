# Regex Training Gist Template

Regex is an interesting way for replacing/modifying documents in coding by locating characters/numbers in markdown to help replace with own coding.

## Summary 

Regular expression consists of multiple inferences including: ^, \w, \d, [a-z], [A-Z], and so on. These are locators to identify: strings, text, functions, and other data sets in coding. By utilizing these tools, coders can find and replace, altering data for better use.  My regex that I chose was ^$\B. This allows for editing the space in between lines of coding. How I did a majority of this gist.

## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors are ^ and $. These two represent the beginning and end to a string.
### Quantifiers
Quantifiers are *, +, ?, and {}. These have the capability of matching strings  with quanitifiable data. AKA grouped data like phone numbers or social security numbers.
### OR Operator
The expressions use | or [ ] to match strings by capturing data.
### Character Classes
Character classes use \d, \w, and \s to highlight single characters, word characters, or whitespace characters.
### Flags
Flags are search patterns delimited by two slash characters such as /abc/. By using flags, they can be combined with whole string or parts.
### Grouping and Capturing
Grouping and capturing use the expressions ( ). This is very useful when needing to extract information from strings or data using your preferred programming language.
### Bracket Expressions
As they state, uses brackets [ ]. This is for  maximizing the usage of strings. This allows for specifying broad range of strings with certain identifying factors.
### Greedy and Lazy Match
Quantifiers, also known as greedy and lazy operators, they allow for the capture of the div in a dom.
### Boundaries
Boundaries allows for regular expressions to represent almost like an anchor but can specify a certain region of the coding.
### Back-references
This can be used to back reference text or strings previously declared. 
### Look-ahead and Look-behind
This allows for picking and choosing of updating content but matching strings but only if followed by specifications.
